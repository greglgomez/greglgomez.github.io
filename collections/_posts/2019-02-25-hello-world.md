Inspired by [Tom Critchlow's](http://tomcritchlow.com/) work on his personal wiki, I've overhauled my own site and made my own wiki. I think he's onto something in it's simplicity and effectiveness. I've started as barebones as possible and will iterate from here.

I'll follow up on shortly on what the setup is here in case anyone is curious. :)
