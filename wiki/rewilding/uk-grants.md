# UK Grants

UK Gov has a good few schemes to help out people who want to plant woodlands, you can get grants for [developing a woodland management plan](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/woodland-management-plan-grant-countryside-stewardship), along with help from the Forestry Commission in setting up a plan that makes sense for your land. link

They also provide grants for [woodland creation](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/woodland-creation-grant-countryside-stewardship), with funding to supply, plant, weed and protect young trees. link

Hereâ€™s a [comprehensive list](https://www.gov.uk/countryside-stewardship-grants?land_use%5B%5D=grassland) of all the Countryside Stewardship grants the government offer.

It's also worth talking to the Woodland Trust, they have a whole section on [Large Scale tree planting](https://www.woodlandtrust.org.uk/plant-trees/large-scale/) and the support they can provide includes: Tailored advice, Grants and funding & Trees and protection.
