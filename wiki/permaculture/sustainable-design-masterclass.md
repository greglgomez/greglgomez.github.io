Highly recommend checking out the YouTube channel, [Sustainable Design Masterclass][1]. They are slowly releasing a bunch of their webinars for free about Regenerative System Design (RSD). As they say on their website, it's great content for farmerts, ecologists, homestearders or preppers on how to restore degraded land and preparing it for the future.

You can also sign up to their newsletter on [their website][2] for some more free content.
